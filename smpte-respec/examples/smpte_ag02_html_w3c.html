    <h2>Scope</h2>

    <p>This Administrative Guideline defines the numbering format for SMPTE Engineering
	    Documents and specifies the permitted file formats used during document development
    	and publication. It also specifies other matters relating to SMPTE Engineering
	    Documents with regard to language, style, format, document type, markups required
	    at various stages of development, etc.</p>

	<p>Files that show the differences between two versions of the same document are
		called &ldquo;markups&ldquo; in this Administrative Guideline. "Markup" is intended to cover
		a variety of terms including: &ldquo;redline,&ldquo; 
		&ldquo;tracked changes,&ldquo; &ldquo;blackline,&ldquo; etc...</p>
  </section>

  <section id='language'>
  	<h2>Language</h2>
    <p>All SMPTE Engineering documents shall be written in U.S. English. Translations
    	into other languages by SMPTE (or by 3rd parties authorized by SMPTE) are
    	encouraged but not required. In the event of discrepancy, the original English
    	language document shall be authoritative.</p>

    <h2>Style and Form</h2>

    <section id='style-guidelines'>
      <h3>Style Guidelines</h3>

	<p>All Engineering Documents should follow the guidelines of the International Organization
		for Standardization (ISO) Directives with the following exceptions: In the event of a
		conflict, explicit provisions of SMPTE Operations Manuals and Administrative Guidelines
		shall prevail. Any variances from the ISO Directives shall be approved by the Director
		of Engineering or the Standards Vice President.</p>

	 <p>Particular attention should be given to the following annexes of the ISO
	 	Directives, Part 2:
	 	<ul>
			<li>Annex B, Basic reference works</li>
			<li>Annex C, Example of numbering of divisions and subdivisions</li>
			<li>Annex D, Drafting and presentation of terms and definitions</li>
			<li>Annex E, Drafting of the title of a document</li>

    <section id="revisions-and-amendments">
      <h3>Revisions and Amendments</h3>
		<p>A revision of an Engineering Document may use the original template if the
			resulting prose is identical to that resulting from use of the current
			template and the Standards Vice President or Director of Engineering agree
			to the use of the original publication template.</p>
			
		<p>For a revision of an Engineering Document, the Project Group should start
			with the Publication Master, which usually can be obtained from SMPTE HQ.
			The Project Group may, at its discretion, recreate the original document,
			as published, if an editable master cannot be found. The Project Group is
			encouraged to follow the ISO Directives but is under no obligation to do
			so.</p>

	<h2>Publication Formats and Elements</h2>
	<section id="publication-formats-overview">
	  <h3>Publication Formats Overview</h3>
      <p>SMPTE Engineering Documents may be published on paper or in various electronic
      formats and may comprise one or more separate elements. An Engineering Document
      always shall include a single prose element and may include other elements such as
      XML, spreadsheets, media files, and so forth. The collection of elements,
      regardless of formats employed, is the "Engineering Document" as a whole, and
      all elements shall be clearly identified in the prose element
      (see <a href="#elements"></a>). Any change to any element constitutes a change to
      the Engineering Document. The Project Group and the Technology Committee shall
      determine the number of elements for publication. The Director of Engineering
      shall determine the distribution media for all published documents. The format of
      publication shall alter neither the relevance of, nor the processes that otherwise
      are required for approval of, an Engineering Document.</p>
      
	<p>Engineering Document Elements may be packaged as one or more Elements using
		ZIP to facilitate the organization and distribution of the component files.</p>

      <h3>SMPTE HQ Guidance</h3>

      <p>The Director of Engineering shall store and process documents in the format
      		chosen by a Project Group and/or Technology Committee. The Director of
	      	Engineering shall ensure that copies of the editable source documents are
	      	maintained for all published Engineering Documents. The editable publication
	      	master should be made available by the Director of Engineering when a
	      	Revision or Amendment project is started.</p>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section id='normative-language-forms'>
	<h2>Normative Language Forms</h3>
	<p>Normative information in a SMPTE Engineering Document may take the language form
	of prose, tables, figures, formal languages (e.g., mathematical formulae, BNF, XML,
	pseudo code), and other language forms. Mathematical formulae shall follow the
	definitions documented in ISO 80000-2 when possible. When ISO 80000-2 is not
	sufficient (e.g., BNF, XML Schema, etc.), a Normative Reference for the mathematical
	definitions used shall be provided. Such Normative Reference shall comply with the
	provisions of the SMPTE Standards Operations Manual and AG-03 Normative References.</p>

	<p>When language forms other than prose are present, the prose shall state whether the
	language is normative or informative. Normative provisions shall be enabled
	explicitly (e.g., "The dimensions of figure 1 shall be used."). The presence of
	non-prose information without prose conformance language shall be deemed
	informative.</p>
  </section>

  <section id='dates'>
    <h2>Dates</h2>

    <p>In accordance with ISO 8601-2004, all dates shall be represented in the form
   		YYYY- MM-DD as numeric digits (e.g. 2009-04-23 to indicate April 23, 2009).</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id='document-numbering'>
	<h2>Document Numbering</h2>
	<section id='document-numbering-overview'>
		<h3>Document Numbering Overview</h3>
		<p>Document numbers shall be unique and uniform across all Engineering Document
			types. Versions of documents shall be identified by their year of publication
			and, optionally, their month of publication, appended with a separating colon
			(e.g., for document #1020: 1020:2009 or 1020:2009-04, the latter indicating
			publication in April, 2009). Figure 1 shows an example of the document numbering
			structure.<p>
		
		<p>The Director of Engineering shall assign document numbers (or root document
			numbers, in the case of multipart documents). Document numbers may be
			assigned at the request of the Technology Committee Chair(s) at any time
			after a Project is approved and shall be assigned before a Final Committee
			Draft ballot is issued.</p>
			
		<p>Older Engineering Documents may bear one-, two-, or three-digit document
			numbers or root document numbers. These numbers shall not be prepended
			with leading zeroes when formatted for printing, either in the document
			itself or in citations in other documents. Such document numbers shall be
			prepended with leading zeroes to fill them out to four digits, however, when
			used as part of an element’s filename; the purpose is to facilitate sorting
			into numerical order.</p>

	<section id='engineering-document-type'>
		<h3>Engineering Document Type</h3>
		<p>The Type of Engineering Document (Standard, Recommended Practice or
			Engineering Guideline) shall be denoted by prepending a Type Designator,
			followed by a single space, to the document’s root number. The Type
			Designator shall be as follows:
			<dl>
				<dt>ST</dt> <dd>Standard</dd>
				<dt>RP</dt> <dd>Recommended Practice</dd>
				<dt>EG</dt> <dd>Engineering Guideline</dd>
			</dl>
		</p>

		<p>Although they are not Engineering Documents, Registered Disclosure Documents,
			Advisory Notes, Administrative Guidelines, and Engineering Reports shall bear
			Type Designators as follows:
			<dl>
				<dt>RDD</dt> <dd>Registered Disclosure Document</dd>
				<dt>AN</dt> <dd>Advisory Note</dd>
				<dt>AG</dt> <dd>Administrative Guideline</dd>
				<dt>ER</dt> <dd>Engineering Report</dd>
				<dt>OV</dt> <dd>Overview Document (Part 0 Document)</dd>
			</dl>
		</p>
		<p>RDDs and ERs shall be numbered using independent number spaces. The numbers
			shall be assigned by SMPTE Headquarters staff.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='parts'>
		<h3>Parts</h3>
		<p>Closely related Engineering Documents may be created as Parts. A Part of a
			document is a separate Engineering Document and shall be shown to be related to
			other documents by using the same root document number plus a suffix of a hyphen
			and the Part number to distinguish among Parts (e.g. 1020-2:2009, indicating
			document 1020, Part 2).</p>

		<section id='parts-of-different-types'>
			<h4>Parts of Different Types</h4>
			<p>A multipart set of documents may include Parts of different types of
				Engineering Documents, including Standards, Recommended Practices, and
				Engineering Guidelines. Each Part’s number shall include the appropriate
				document type designation (e. g. RP 2046-2:2009).</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id='part-0-documents'>
			<h4>Part 0 Documents</h4>
			<p>A multipart set of documents should be supplemented by an informative
				Part 0, informally described as an “Overview Document,” which shall
				describe the relationships among the Parts and may describe the
				relationships of the Parts to other Engineering Documents. Part 0
				documents are not due process Engineering Documents.</p>
				
			<p>Part 0 documents usually should be prepared by the authors of the related
				engineering documents in cooperation with SMPTE headquarters staff and
				the responsible Technology Committee and Project Group. Part 0 documents
				shall be maintained by the Director of Engineering in consultation with
				the Technology Committee Chair(s) and the author(s) of the Part 0
				document. If new Parts are added to a multipart set, or if any of the
				Parts of the set are revised, Part 0 shall be revised at the same time.
				The Part 0 designation shall not be used for any Engineering Document.
				Part 0 documents shall not bear a Type designator
				(i.e. it is not an ST, RP or EG).</p>
				
			<p>A Part 0 document should not contain forward-looking statements in regard
				to documents that are not ready for publication.</p>
				
			<p>As a general guideline, Part 0 documents should use the following
				structure:
				<ol>
					<li>an overview of the general application of the related engineering
						documents, in a language that can be understood by non-experts</li>
					<li>an overview of the scope of various related documents, with
					graphical representations, if appropriate</li>
					<li>an overview of the contextual relationships of various
						engineering documents</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>Examples of Part 0 documents: SMPTE 2052-0 or SMPTE 425-0.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id='normative-referecnes-to-multipart-documents'>
			<h4>Normative References to Multipart Documents</h4>
			<p>Normative references to multipart documents always shall specify the
				individual Part or Parts being referenced and shall not reference the
				entire set by root number alone.</p>
		</section>
	</section>
		
	<section id='elements'>
		<h3>Elements</h3>
		<p>Non-prose Elements of Engineering Documents (see Section 4 Publication Formats
			and Elements) shall be designated using a lower case letter (e.g. 1020a:2009
			and 1020b:2009). Media such as DVDs, as well as non-PDF formats, shall be
			clearly marked, as appropriate. The single prose element shall not receive a
			letter suffix.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section id='number-space'>
		<h3>Number Space</h3>
		<p>All new Engineering Documents shall share a common root number space,
			starting with 2000, except for new Parts of multipart documents that
			have a one-, two- or three-digit root.</p>

		<p>In the past, each type of Engineering Document had its own number space.
			This presented difficulties when a Technology Committee determined that the
			document type had to be changed (for example, changing a Recommended Practice
			to a Standard) if the number in the new number space already was in use. To
			address this going forward, the block of numbers from 1000 to 1999 has been
			allocated.</p>

		<p>If a Technology Committee determines that the classification of an Engineering
			Document with a one-, two- or three-digit root must be changed (e.g., from a
			Recommended Practice to a Standard) and there already is an Engineering
			Document with that number, the document whose classification is being
			changed shall have 1000 added to its root. For example, if the Technology
			Committee were to determine that Recommended Practice RP 222 should be
			changed to a Standard, its number would be changed to SMPTE ST 1222 because
			there already is a SMPTE ST 222.</p>
			
		<p>Each of the other published document types (i.e., Registered Disclosure
			Documents, Advisory Notes, Administrative Guidelines, and Engineering
			Reports) shall have its own number space independent of Engineering Documents
			and of each other. They otherwise shall follow the rules for document
			numbering specified in this Administrative Guideline.</p>
